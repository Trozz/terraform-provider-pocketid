# pocketid_group (Resource)

Manages a user group in Pocket-ID. Groups can be used to organize users and control access to OIDC clients.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Create a basic group
resource "pocketid_group" "developers" {
  name          = "developers"
  friendly_name = "Development Team"
}

# Create multiple groups for different roles
resource "pocketid_group" "admins" {
  name          = "admins"
  friendly_name = "System Administrators"
}

resource "pocketid_group" "users" {
  name          = "users"
  friendly_name = "Regular Users"
}

resource "pocketid_group" "qa_team" {
  name          = "qa"
  friendly_name = "Quality Assurance Team"
}

# Create groups with users assigned
resource "pocketid_group" "managers" {
  name          = "managers"
  friendly_name = "Management Team"
}

resource "pocketid_user" "manager" {
  username   = "john.manager"
  email      = "john.manager@example.com"
  first_name = "John"
  last_name  = "Manager"

  groups = [pocketid_group.managers.id]
}

# Use groups to control client access
resource "pocketid_client" "internal_app" {
  name = "Internal Application"

  callback_urls = [
    "https://internal.example.com/callback"
  ]

  # Only developers and admins can access this client
  allowed_user_groups = [
    pocketid_group.developers.id,
    pocketid_group.admins.id
  ]
}

# Create groups dynamically
locals {
  departments = {
    "engineering" = "Engineering Department"
    "sales"       = "Sales Department"
    "marketing"   = "Marketing Department"
    "hr"          = "Human Resources"
  }
}

resource "pocketid_group" "departments" {
  for_each = local.departments

  name          = each.key
  friendly_name = each.value
}

# Output group IDs for use in other configurations
output "developer_group_id" {
  value = pocketid_group.developers.id
}

output "department_groups" {
  value = {
    for k, v in pocketid_group.departments : k => v.id
  }
}
```
