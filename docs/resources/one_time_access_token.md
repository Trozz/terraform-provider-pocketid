# pocketid_one_time_access_token (Resource)

Manages a one-time access token for a user in Pocket-ID. These tokens allow users to authenticate when they don't have access to their passkey.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Create a one-time access token for a user (expires_at is required)
resource "pocketid_one_time_access_token" "example" {
  user_id    = pocketid_user.example.id
  expires_at = timeadd(timestamp(), "24h") # Token expires in 24 hours
}

# Create a one-time access token with custom expiry (1 hour from now)
resource "pocketid_one_time_access_token" "temporary" {
  user_id    = pocketid_user.example.id
  expires_at = timeadd(timestamp(), "1h")
}

# Example with user creation
resource "pocketid_user" "example" {
  username   = "temporary.user"
  email      = "temp@example.com"
  first_name = "Temporary"
  last_name  = "User"
}

# Output the token (marked as sensitive)
output "access_token" {
  description = "The one-time access token for the user"
  value       = pocketid_one_time_access_token.example.token
  sensitive   = true
}

# Use case: Create a token for emergency access
resource "pocketid_user" "emergency" {
  username   = "emergency.access"
  email      = "emergency@example.com"
  first_name = "Emergency"
  last_name  = "Access"
  is_admin   = true
}

resource "pocketid_one_time_access_token" "emergency" {
  user_id    = pocketid_user.emergency.id
  expires_at = timeadd(timestamp(), "24h") # Valid for 24 hours
}

# Note: One-time access tokens are useful when users need to authenticate
# from a device where they don't have access to their passkey.
# The token can only be used once and should be treated as a secret.

# Use case: Initial user setup with skip_recreate
# This prevents Terraform from recreating the token after it's been used
resource "pocketid_user" "new_user" {
  username   = "new.employee"
  email      = "new.employee@company.com"
  first_name = "New"
  last_name  = "Employee"
}

resource "pocketid_one_time_access_token" "onboarding" {
  user_id       = pocketid_user.new_user.id
  expires_at    = timeadd(timestamp(), "168h") # Valid for 7 days
  skip_recreate = true                         # Don't recreate if token is used
}

# Send the token via another provider (e.g., email, SMS)
# This is just an example - use your actual notification provider
resource "example_email" "welcome" {
  to      = pocketid_user.new_user.email
  subject = "Welcome to Pocket-ID"
  body    = <<-EOT
    Welcome ${pocketid_user.new_user.first_name}!

    Please use this one-time access token to log in and set up your passkey:
    ${pocketid_one_time_access_token.onboarding.token}

    This token will expire in 7 days.
  EOT
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `expires_at` (String) The expiration time of the token in RFC3339 format
- `user_id` (String) The ID of the user this token belongs to

### Optional

- `skip_recreate` (Boolean) If true (default), the resource will not be recreated when the token is not found (used or expired). This is useful for initial user setup where the token is sent via another provider. Note: Setting this to false will enable standard Terraform behavior, where the resource is recreated if the token is missing.

### Read-Only

- `created_at` (String) The creation time of the token in RFC3339 format
- `id` (String) The unique identifier of the one-time access token (same as user_id)
- `token` (String, Sensitive) The one-time access token value

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
# One-time access tokens can be imported using the user ID
terraform import pocketid_one_time_access_token.example "user-id-123"

# Note: The token value itself cannot be retrieved after creation,
# so it will not be available in the state after import.
```
