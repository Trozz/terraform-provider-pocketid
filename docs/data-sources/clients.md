# pocketid_clients (Data Source)

Fetches all OIDC clients from Pocket-ID.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Fetch all OIDC clients
data "pocketid_clients" "all" {}

# Output total client count
output "total_clients" {
  value = length(data.pocketid_clients.all.clients)
}

# List all client names
output "client_names" {
  value = [for client in data.pocketid_clients.all.clients : client.name]
}

# Find public clients
locals {
  public_clients = [
    for client in data.pocketid_clients.all.clients : client
    if client.is_public
  ]

  confidential_clients = [
    for client in data.pocketid_clients.all.clients : client
    if !client.is_public
  ]
}

output "public_client_count" {
  value = length(local.public_clients)
}

output "confidential_client_count" {
  value = length(local.confidential_clients)
}

# Create a map of clients by name
locals {
  clients_by_name = {
    for client in data.pocketid_clients.all.clients : client.name => client
  }
}

# Access a specific client from the map
output "spa_client_id" {
  value = lookup(local.clients_by_name, "React SPA Application", null) != null ? local.clients_by_name["React SPA Application"].id : "Client not found"
}

# Find clients with specific callback URLs
locals {
  localhost_clients = [
    for client in data.pocketid_clients.all.clients : client
    if anytrue([for url in client.callback_urls : can(regex("localhost", url))])
  ]
}

output "development_clients" {
  description = "Clients configured for localhost development"
  value       = [for client in local.localhost_clients : client.name]
}
```
